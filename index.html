    <p>
      Salt Spring Island is a small island off the coast of British Columbia,
      right beside the much larger Vancouver Island. The island has several
      provincial parks on it, all with pleasant walks through nature, and some
      with places<a href="https://bcparks.ca/ruckle-park/#park-camping-details-container" target="_blank"> to camp in.</a> Many of the locals are artists who make and sell
      their art in town or right out of their studios. The whole island is so
      quiet and peaceful, visiting is always the highlight of my vacation.

    <h2>Favorite Vacation:</h2>
    <h2>Drumheller</h2>
    <p class="center"><img src="img/Hoodoos.jpg" alt="Hoodoos" width="600" /></p>
    <p>
      Called the City of Dinosaurs, Drumheller holds many amazing sights and
      experiences to enjoy. The highlights of my visit were:
      <ul>
        <li>The Royal Tyrell Museum</li>
        <li>Climbing straight up and out of the valley</li>
          <li>The
            <a href="https://www.worldslargestdinosaur.com/index.html" target="_blank"
              >Worlds Largest Dinosaur.</a
            ></li>
      </ul>
      
      It was a great place to visit for a week, but far too hot for me to want
      to live there.

    <h2>Favorite Food:</h2>
    <h2>Sushi</h2>

    <p>Along with the rest of my family, my favorite food is sushi. Every time there is a special day like a birthday or significant holiday, we always go for sushi dinner to celebrate! Our favorite place to go is a restaurant called <a href="https://nomiyarestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Nomiya</a>, but they changed their menu a while ago, so we have been trying other restaurants recently.</p>
